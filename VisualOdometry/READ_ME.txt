C#/OpenCV

Description: Given a monocular camera, give it the ability to track itself by processing the obtained frame and aided by visual odometry techniques and OpenCV library create the corresponding map of the path taken.

Obstacles Avoidance also implemented by considering the premisse that "in the begining, safe ground is what is on front of the camera and it defers from the walls" so I'll search for something with the same caracteristics(HSL and not RGB).

Not all code was written by me, time was short so a whole lot of "google coding" was involved, but no copyrights were invaded.
Requires camera calibration to work.

Right now I consider this as a scrapyard of code.
So Take what you can salvage.
